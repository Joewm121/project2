                <em> Welcome</em> to my first solo project here at Epicodus,this page displays what i've learned in my first week. A little about me, born and raised here in Oregon, I've spent most of my life surrounded by technology. I used to hassle my parents about our slow dial-up internet and lack of a computer capable of playing the simplest of game, after years of bugging them we finally got 1.5Mbps DSL which at the time felt like we had just upgraded to fiber. Next was to build a PC, I built my first computer in a computer class at my high school, it was pentium 2, rocking 256mb of ram and a 40gig hard drive. To date couldn't tell you how many I've built, only that they are continuously superior

                  After high school I went to work for a Beer distributor, I started off as  Merchandiser where I was tasked with filling the shelves of local stores, after a few years I was promoted to a unique position within Customer Service, I was to become the "jack of all trades" for the department, as well as being the delivery driver for orders that were missed or forgotten. After a couple years, many attempts to get into Sales and a break up, I was tired, burnt out and need a change. For me 2016 was spent grinding through my work days and selling most what I owned in preparation for what I love most;Traveling. Australia provided me time not only to explore an amazing country but to also let me think and make rational decisions on what my next move should be. I spent 4 months backpacking around the country experiencing all I could. In the end had some amazing experiences, from 4,000km road trips to working on a dive boat and getting to dive 3 times a day. I met tons of amazing people from all walks of life, each one seeking something different with a different outlook on life.

                  <p>For this project we were to build an animal adoption page, our page presents the opportunity to adopt your very own Aardvark. The focus of this page was to practice using:
                    <ul>
                      <li class="list">Add classes to style large chunks of our page.</li>
                      <li class="list">applying classes to multiple HTML tags.</li>
                      <li class="list">inking an email address with the anchor tag.</li>
                      <li class="listlang"><strong>Languages: HTML,CSS, JavaScript.</strong></li>

                      In this example we were practicing using:

                        <li class="list">A container to pad all content.</li>

                        <li class="list">a section with blockquotes to contain what previous visitors to this area have said.</li>
                        <li class="list">several helper classes to add color that emphasizes certain areas of the page.</li>
