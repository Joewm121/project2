                <em> Welcome</em> to my first solo project here at Epicodus,this page displays what i've learned in my first week. A little about me, born and raised here in Oregon, I've spent most of my life surrounded by technology. I used to hassle my parents about our slow dial-up internet and lack of a computer capable of playing the simplest of game, after years of bugging them we finally got 1.5Mbps DSL which at the time felt like we had just upgraded to fiber. Next was to build a PC, I built my first computer in a computer class at my high school, it was pentium 2, rocking 256mb of ram and a 40gig hard drive. To date couldn't tell you how many I've built, only that they are continuously superior

                  After high school I went to work for a Beer distributor, I started off as  Merchandiser where I was tasked with filling the shelves of local stores, after a few years I was promoted to a unique position within Customer Service, I was to become the "jack of all trades" for the department, as well as being the delivery driver for orders that were missed or forgotten. After a couple years, many attempts to get into Sales and a break up, I was tired, burnt out and need a change. For me 2016 was spent grinding through my work days and selling most what I owned in preparation for what I love most;Traveling. Australia provided me time not only to explore an amazing country but to also let me think and make rational decisions on what my next move should be. I spent 4 months backpacking around the country experiencing all I could. In the end had some amazing experiences, from 4,000km road trips to working on a dive boat and getting to dive 3 times a day. I met tons of amazing people from all walks of life, each one seeking something different with a different outlook on life.

                      <li class="list">Add classes to style large chunks of our page.</li>

       <h3>C#</h3>
       <p>
          C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.

       <h3>JavaScript</h3>
       <p> Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.

     <div id="php2">
       <h3>PHP</h3>
       <p>PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.

       <h3>Ruby</h3>
       <p>
         Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.
